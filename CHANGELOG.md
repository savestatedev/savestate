## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-02

### 🚀 Full OpenClaw Runtime State Capture

The OpenClaw/Clawdbot adapter now captures your **complete agent state** for true personality restoration:

#### New Captures
- **Gateway config** (`openclaw.json`) — agent definitions, model preferences, channel routing
- **Cron jobs** (`cron/jobs.json`) — all scheduled behaviors and reminders
- **Device identity** — device pairing and authentication
- **Paired nodes** — mobile node relationships
- **Channel state** — Telegram update offsets for message continuity
- **Memory databases** — SQLite semantic memory (up to 100MB per agent)
- **Credentials** — channel auth tokens (opt-in with `--include-credentials`)

#### Security
- API keys and secrets are **redacted by default** in gateway config
- Credentials excluded unless explicitly requested
- Memory databases indexed with SHA-256 checksums

#### New CLI Options
```bash
savestate snapshot --include-credentials  # Include channel auth tokens
savestate snapshot --no-redact-secrets    # Keep API keys in config
savestate snapshot --agent-id main        # Backup single agent only
```

#### Additional Identity Files
- Now captures: `IDENTITY.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`

#### Backward Compatible
- Supports all config directory names: `.openclaw`, `.moltbot`, `.clawdbot`
- Supports all gateway config names: `openclaw.json`, `moltbot.json`, `clawdbot.json`

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-29

### Bug Fixes

- **FIXED**: Cloud push "file not found" — was looking in wrong directory (`.savestate/` instead of `~/.savestate/`)
- **FIXED**: CLI `--version` now correctly shows current version (was stuck on 0.1.0)
- **Added**: robots.txt and sitemap.xml for SEO
- **Added**: Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- **Added**: install.sh accessible from website

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-29

### Cloud Storage Improvements

- **Fixed**: CLI now properly calls the cloud storage API (was using wrong endpoints)
- **Fixed**: Storage usage tracking on upload/delete (handles re-uploads correctly)
- **Added**: `savestate cloud delete` command for removing cloud snapshots
- **Improved**: Storage quota calculation accounts for file replacements
- **Improved**: Better error messages for cloud operations

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-29

### 🔒 Security & Pricing Enforcement

- **BREAKING**: Direct cloud storage (S3/R2/B2) removed from free CLI
- Cloud backups now require Pro or Team subscription
- New `savestate cloud` commands for managed cloud storage:
  - `savestate cloud push` — Upload snapshots to SaveState cloud
  - `savestate cloud pull` — Download snapshots from cloud
  - `savestate cloud list` — List cloud snapshots with usage stats
- Server-side subscription verification for all cloud operations
- Storage quotas enforced (Pro: 10GB, Team: 100GB)

### Why This Change

Previously, users could configure their own S3/R2 credentials directly in the CLI,
bypassing the subscription model. This release properly enforces the pricing tiers:

- **Free**: Local storage only, 1 adapter, manual snapshots
- **Pro ($9/mo)**: Cloud storage (10GB), all adapters, scheduled backups
- **Team ($29/mo)**: Cloud storage (100GB), SSO, compliance features

### Migration

If you were using `--storage s3` or similar:

1. Run `savestate login` to authenticate
2. Subscribe to Pro at https://savestate.dev/#pricing
3. Use `savestate cloud push` to upload existing local snapshots
4. Future backups: `savestate snapshot` (local) + `savestate cloud push`

Local storage continues to work unchanged for free users.
