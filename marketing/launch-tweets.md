# SaveState Launch Tweet Thread

## Thread for @SaveStateDev

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your AI knows everything about you.

Your preferences. Your history. Your workflows. Months of conversations.

What's your backup plan?

Introducing SaveState — Time Machine for AI 🧵

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
The problem:

- ChatGPT memories? Gone if you switch.
- Claude projects? Not portable.
- Custom instructions? Lost in a service change.

You've invested months building a relationship with your AI.

None of it is backed up. None of it is portable.

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
SaveState fixes this.

```
savestate snapshot    # Capture your AI's state
savestate restore     # Bring it back anytime
savestate migrate     # Move between platforms
```

Encrypted. Open format. Your data, your keys.

### Tweet 4 (How it works)
How it works:

1. Extract memories, conversations, custom instructions
2. Encrypt with your passphrase (AES-256-GCM)
3. Store locally or sync to cloud
4. Restore to same platform — or migrate to another

ChatGPT → Claude? We've got you.

### Tweet 9 (Why we built this)
Why we built this:

AI assistants are becoming extensions of ourselves. They know our writing style, our preferences, our projects.

But the platforms treat that data as theirs.

We think you should own your AI identity. SaveState makes that possible.

### Tweet 10 (Close)
SaveState is open source and built in public.

Follow along as we add more platforms, more features, and help people take control of their AI relationships.
